    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>
        I am a current business management student at Brigham Young University. My experience as a Benefits Assistant allowed 
        me to develop attention to detail and problem-solving skills while managing benefits eligibility for over 100 companies. 
        Previously, as a Mobile Expert, I honed my ability to communicate effectively and provide tailored solutions to customers. 
        Currently, as a Substitute Teacher, I have learned to adapt quickly to new environments and engage with diverse groups. 
        I thrive in roles that require organization adaptibility, and a people-focused approach.
